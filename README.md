OF Project by Audrey Fox

The Self Control Moniter is an openFrameworks and Arduino application. It uses openCV and firmata Arduino. The base is a 5 minute timer(editable to personal prefrences in the .cpp) with facial recognition. If you go somewhere the app will know and ask 'where'd ya go', so keep studying. But rememember to take a break. When the timer is up the alert displays and the motor shuts your laptop lid, or hits you or knocks something over- fully customizeable based on where you place the servo.  ;)
